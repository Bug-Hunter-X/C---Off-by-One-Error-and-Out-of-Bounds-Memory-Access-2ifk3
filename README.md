This repository contains a simple C++ program demonstrating two common coding errors: off-by-one errors and accessing memory outside of allocated blocks.  The `bug.cpp` file shows the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.cpp` presents a corrected version.  Understanding and avoiding these errors is crucial for writing robust and secure C++ code.
